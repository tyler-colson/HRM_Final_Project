                    A great investment strategy for young adults is investing in a ROTH IRA because you don't pay capital gains taxes, or in other words, you 
                    don't have to pay taxes on what you gained in this account while investing.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Other easy opportunities to invest young is to get into mutual 
                    funds (groups of combined shares in multiple businesses through stocks). The most popular mutual fund is the S&P 500.
                    Look up the best mutual fund for you and your risk tolerance.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Invest in businesses that people need and that provide real utility to their consumers.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Invest in businesses love and are passionate about.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Seek advice on where to invest but do what you want at the end of the day, everyone has their own opinion and there is no one right way to 
                    do things and to succeed in the stock market
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Follow the 40, 40, 20, rule. 40% of your investing should go to safe investments like bonds, treasury bonds, and money market accounts,
                    40% of your investing should go to middle tier investmenets like stocks, mutual funds and real estate, and 20% of your money can go to risky investments 
                    like crypto currency, NFT's, etc.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Crypto is a complicated space and you shouldn't invest unless you have a basic understanding of how it works. The market is extremely volatile 
                    and hasn't behaved like the stock market. Only invest money you can afford to lost in crypto.
